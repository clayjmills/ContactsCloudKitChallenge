// Set up File as an extension of Contact Model, then go set up CloudKitManger(helpers) third

//give key properties, add one for recordtype
//create failable init to take CKRecords from cloudkit and turn them into model objects
//Call initializer
// create computed property to take model objects, give them a CKRecord to go to cloudkit
//instatiate by giving recordType(name of the class which is Contact)
//Set the values of the record type(Contact)
